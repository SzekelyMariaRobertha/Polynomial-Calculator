# Polynomial-Calculator
Design and implement a polynomial calculator with a dedicated graphical interface.

## Requirements
IntelliJ IDEA

## Usage
### Requirements
Design and implement a polynomial calculator with a dedicated graphical interface through which 
the user can insert polynomials, select the mathematical operation (i.e., addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, division, derivative, integration) to be performed and view the result.

Note: Consider the polynomials of one variable and integer coefficients

### Implementation
Model-View-Controller (MVC) is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the controller. Each of these components are built to handle specific aspects of an application's development.
The Model component corresponds to all the data-related logic that the user works with. This can represent the data that is transferred between the View and Controller components. The View component is used for all the UI logic of the application, such as text boxes, buttons, etc. with which the user interacts.
Controllers act as an interface between the Model and View components to manipulate data using the Model component and interact with Views rendering the final output.
